\chapter{Noise in Detectors}
\textit{Poisson noise, shot noise, and photon noise} are often used interchangeably.  Shot noise in simple term, is the noise associated with the random arrival of discrete electrons, and photon noise is often similarly ascribed to the random arrival of discrete photons.  photon noise can also be described as shot noise with photo-electrons.  So photons arrive discretely, which create shot noise, discrete electrons created by discrete arrival of photons.  Assume both photo-electrons and photons are Poisson random processes.
