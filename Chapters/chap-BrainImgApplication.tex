\section{Background}

\noindent \textbf{Patient positioning} \\
\noindent According to the AAPM (American Association of Physicists in Medicine), patient positioning should follow the below list\citep{aapm_headCT2012}
\begin{itemize}
\item patient should lie face upward with the head in a head-holder device whenever possible.  The patient should enter the gantry head first.
\item the scan angle should be parallel to a line created by the supraorbital ridge and the inner table of the posterior margin of the foramen magnum.  This may be accomplished by either tilting the patient's chin toward the chest ("tucked" position" or tilting the gantry.
\end{itemize}
